Hello, World

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX.
It aims to learn about what is entry point,basic commands(printf,puts,putchar),compilation process with gcc.

Technologies
scripts written in bash
Tested on ubuntu 20.04LTS
C files are compiled using gcc
 
All the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

0-preprocessor Runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
1-compiler  Compiles a C file but does not link.
2-assembler Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
3-name      Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
4-puts.c    Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
5-printf.c  Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line
6-size.c    Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
100-intel   Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
101-quote.c Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
