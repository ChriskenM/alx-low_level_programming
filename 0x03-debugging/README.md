# Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.

+ **Multiple mains** is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project.
+ **1-main.c** Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
+ **2-largest_number.c, main.h**          Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
+ **3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h** Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
