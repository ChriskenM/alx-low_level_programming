#Technologies
Some files were compiled by **gcc**
files are written in **C** 
files include header files 

# Files:

+ **0-object_like_macro.h** a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
+ **1-pi.h** a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
+ **2-main.c**  a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
+ **3-function_like_macro.h** a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
+ **4-sum.h** a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
